# Kilo - My Pet Text Editor

This is a pet text editor I wrote in C. Nothing fancy, but it
will be a functioning text editor

## Instructions
If you wish to build it for yourself, just install clang and make, clone the
repo, `cd` into it, and run `make` It will output an executable file called
`kilo`. Provide a text file as an argument to open it.
